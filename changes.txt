==========
gNumer fixed in alpha1_check_params() function in lfl-utils-alpha1Variable.gp
and alpha3_check_params() function in lfl-utils-alpha3Variable.gp
incorrect "2*" removed

isComplex not correctly passed between functions in lfl-utils-alpha1Variable.gp
causing incorrect degenerate case results in some cases

added new functions:
alpha1_check_params_with_d1d2() in lfl-utils-alpha1Variable.gp
alpha3_check_params_with_d1d2() in lfl-utils-alpha3Variable.gp
useful for problems like the linear forms in logs for Catalan's conjecture,
where d_1 and d_2 in our "kit" manuscript can be large

added new function
check_bounds() in lfl-utils-general.gp
to make user programs easier (updated examples to follow)

2022-11-11
==========
lfl-utils-alpha1Variable.gp:
correct if clauses for c2 calculation

lfl-utils-alpha3Variable.gp:
call alpha3_check_params_with_d1d2(), not alpha1_check_params_with_d1d2, in alpha3_check_params()

==========
change interpolation matrices to use Michel Waldschmidt's (see Chapter 7 of his book, ``Diophantine Approximation on Linear Algebraic Groups'')
this improves the results obtained by roughly a factor of 5 over the previous correct results
modify all files appropriately, including example files

now use Theorem 2 of Laurent's 2008 paper, rather than the corollaries in that paper.
this removes influence of degenerate case for complex linear forms and gets us to within 50% of best possible non-degenerate result for real linear forms
(see start of Section 3 of kit paper for definitions of real and complex linear forms)
modify all files appropriately, including example files

rename all files so first part of name creates a ``namespace''.
files containing user code (examples, say) all start with "eg-"
files containing functions for users of the kit all start with "kit-".
files containing internal implementation of the kit all start with "utils-".

multiple levels of logging now supported
dbg=0: no internal logging displayed
dbg=1: all step 3 logging displayed and some step 4 logging displayed
dbg=2: all step 3 and step 4 logging displayed
this was due to all the logging produced when doing search for best \varrho and \mu in Theorem 2 in Laurent's 2008 paper

==========
improve error messages and error handling

2023-03-31
==========
added new file, eg-bgmp-eqn29.gp, for equation (2.9) in proof of Prop 3.5
of Bennett, Gyory, Mignotte and Pinter's Comp. Math (2006) paper.

2023-06-02
==========
added new files, eg-bgmp-eqn28.gp and eg-bgmp-eqn210.gp, for equations (2.8) and
(2.10) in proof of Prop 3.5 of Bennett, Gyory, Mignotte and Pinter's Comp. Math (2006) paper.

renamed eg-mignotte1.gp to eg-bgmp-eqn27.gp for equation (2.7) in proof of
Prop 3.5 of Bennett, Gyory, Mignotte and Pinter's Comp. Math (2006) paper.
They are the same.

2023-08-07
==========
added new file, eg-bdms.gp for Proposition 3.1
of Bennett, Dahmen, Mignotte and Siksek's Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc (2015) paper.

changed format and output of a few print statements too.

2023-12-29
==========
small improvements to a few print statements
