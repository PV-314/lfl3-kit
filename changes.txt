==========
gNumer fixed in alpha1_check_params() function in lfl-utils-alpha1Variable.gp
incorrect "2*" removed

isComplex not correctly passed between functions in lfl-utils-alpha1Variable.gp
causing incorrect degenerate case results in some cases

added new functions:
alpha1_check_params_with_d1d2() in lfl-utils-alpha1Variable.gp
alpha3_check_params_with_d1d2() in lfl-utils-alpha3Variable.gp
useful for problems like the linear forms in logs for Catalan's conjecture,
where d_1 and d_2 in our "kit" manuscript can be large

added new function
check_bounds() in lfl-utils-general.gp
to make user programs easier (updated examples to follow)
